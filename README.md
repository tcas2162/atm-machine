# atm-machine
 This is a simple React App that simulates an ATM machine. When you navigate to the page, you are presented with a page that asks you to select an action from a drop down menu to continue. You can select "Deposit" to add money or "Money Back" to withdraw money provided your balance is above $0. If you attempt to withdraw more than your existing account balance, the submit button will be disabled. Similarly, you will also receive an alert if your transaction brings your account balance to $0. In future iterations of this app, I plan to add transitions for a smoother, more intuitive user experience, as well as an expanded color scheme to help enhance the application's visual identity.
